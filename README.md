# Project Overview

This project aims to develop a simple and functional web application for detecting duplicate words in a text. The purpose of this project is to provide a practical tool that can be used in a variety of contexts, such as content editing, data cleaning, and more. In the current digital age, where data is increasingly voluminous, the need for efficient and effective duplicate detection tools has become more pronounced. This application serves to fulfill this need by offering a simple yet effective solution. The context of this project lies within the broader landscape of data processing and web development, where the ability to quickly and accurately detect duplicates can save time and ensure the quality of the output.

# Requirements

This project has several key requirements, which include:
- Full-stack web development: The application should be a fully functional web application, complete with front-end and back-end components.
- Duplicate detection: The primary function of the application is to detect duplicate words in a text. The application should be able to accurately identify duplicates and display the results to the user.
- Professional code: The code should be clean, well-structured, and commented where necessary. It should adhere to established coding standards and best practices.
- Responsive design: The application should have a responsive design, ensuring that it is accessible and usable on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
- Error handling: The application should incorporate proper error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

# Installation & Setup

To use this application, follow these steps:
1. Download the project files. You should have a single HTML file named `index.html`.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The application is now ready to use.
3. To modify or extend the functionality of the application, open the `index.html` file in a text editor. You will find all the CSS styles within the `<style>` tags and the JavaScript code within the `<script>` tags.

# Usage Instructions

To use the application, simply enter the text in the input field and press the "Detect" button. The application will process the text and display any detected duplicate words below the button. If no duplicates are detected, the result area will remain empty. This simple workflow ensures that users can quickly and easily check their text for duplicates.

# Technical Details

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structure of the application, the CSS provides the styling, and the JavaScript provides the functionality. The JavaScript code uses a simple algorithm to detect duplicates. It splits the text into an array of words, then traverses the array, comparing each word with every other word. If a duplicate is found, it is added to a separate array, which is then displayed to the user.

# Troubleshooting

If the application is not functioning correctly, there are several steps you can take. First, ensure that you are opening the `index.html` file in a web browser. If the application does not display correctly, check that your browser is up to date and supports modern web standards. If the duplicate detection function is not working, ensure that you are entering text in the input field and clicking the "Detect" button. If you are still experiencing issues, check the JavaScript console for any error messages. These messages can help identify any issues with the code.
